## Energy Sources Jack

### Main features:

*   High power and charging rate
*   Remote control unit
*   Up to 3 times lighter and more compact than analogues
*   Easy control and programming of cycles
*   Power consumption control


**Jacks** are the lightest, most compact, and fastest energy sources in the world that ensure the operation of borehole sparker and electrodynamic sources used in geophysical surveys including [cross-hole seismic testing (ASTM D4428/D4428M) and tomography (CST)](https://geodevice.ca/info/publications/), high-resolution VSP, and reverse VSP or vertical seismoacoustic profiling (VSaP).

Our convenient and intuitive **Jack** control panel allows flexibility in configuring the shooting mode. It is easy to program the cycle with the required number of shots and the period between them, the required energy and power consumption, as well as triggering from a seismic station or a synchronization system. Remote control unit JackPad duplicates the control panel and allows the seismic station operator to fully control the entire system. It is important to say that JackPad also provides additional safety of work.

In **Jack-500** and **Jack-1200** models, pulse chargers provide a charge rate 500 J/s. More powerful versions are equipped with even faster chargers with a rate up to 3000 J/s and adjustable maximum power consumption. Thus, all energy sources **Jack** can work with compact portable 110 / 220 V generators (with power from 1 kW). **Jack**’s design deploys a reliable thyristor key, that enables obtaining a really short high-voltage electric pulse.

Compact size, light weight, shockproof and dustproof casing, intuitive user interface, remote control unit, as well as high charging rate make energy sources Jack the most modern and truly mobile devices compared to all the alternatives available on the market. Specialized energy sources [MultiJack](https://geodevice.ca/product/multijack/) that support the latest shooting technologies, as well as a whole line of sources and other necessary equipment are available for marine high-resolution seismic surveys.

**Jack application areas:**

*   Borehole seismic surveys on land and in water areas using cross-hole seismic testing and tomography (CST), vertical seismic profiling (VSP), high-resolution VSP, reverse VSP, vertical seismoacoustic profiling (VSaP)
*   Engineering surveys for the construction of highly sensitive facilities
*   Search for karsts, fractured and deconsolidated zones, and mining geophysics
*   Geotechnical monitoring of the soil foundation and determination of its load-bearing capacity, including in accordance with ASTM D4428 / D4428M standard
*   Cracks location in concrete hydroelectric dams
*   Mineral exploration


**Delivery set:**

*   Energy source Jack
*   Synchronization connector (2 pcs.)
*   Power cable
*   Documentation kit


**In addition to energy sources Jack the following items can be purchased:**

*   Remote control unit JackPad
*   Borehole sources of pressure (P) waves ([Pulse](https://geodevice.ca/product/pulse/)) or shear (S) waves of horizontal ([SHock](https://geodevice.ca/product/shock/)) and vertical ([GeoSV](https://geodevice.ca/product/geosv/)) polarization
*   High frequency seismic stations [Sigma 4+](https://geodevice.ca/product/sigma4/) and [DAQlink 4](https://geodevice.ca/product/daqlink4/)
*   Borehole hydrophone array [WellStreamer](https://geodevice.ca/product/wellstreamer/)
*   Single and multi-level 3C borehole probes with spring ([GStreamer](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer/)), pneumatic ([GStreamer-P](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer-p/)), and electromechanical ([GStreamer-E](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer-e/)) anchoring systems
*   Winches and reels [BGW](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw/) / [BGW light](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw_light/) / [RT-4S](https://geodevice.ca/product/kt-4c/) for cable lines
*   Borehole inclinometers [INCLIS](https://geodevice.ca/product/inclis/)
*   Universal switchbox for source connection
