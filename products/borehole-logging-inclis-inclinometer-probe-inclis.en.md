## Inclinometer Probe INCLIS

### Main features:

*   3D borehole deviation survey
*   Exceptional simplicity and reliability
*   Does not require a logging station
*   3 accelerometers and 3 magnetic sensors
*   360° orientation range


**INCLIS** probe is designed to determine well axis deviation and its azimuth. Inclinometry is usually performed when drilling directional wells, monitoring the movement of soil and structures, plotting maps and sections, when logging and drilling data is involved.

**INCLIS** probes are equipped with a three-component magnetic compass and accelerometer. The accelerometer measures the angle of the probe relative to the gravity vector. Magnetic compass determines the direction of inclination of the wellbore in an open or plastic cased well. If the well has metal casing or drilled in an iron ore massif, that excludes the possibility of three-component magnetometer use, the orientation of the inclinometer is performed using special rods from the surface. Rods and rod feeder can be used to perform inclinometry in both sub-horizontal and vertical wells.

**INCLIS** probes consist of a module with electronics and an extension. The extension is designed to stabilize the probe in the well. Standard package also includes a pair of interchangeable Teflon centering cylinders and a detachable cable line on a compact and lightweight reel made of durable plastic. Real-time measurements are transmitted via Wi-Fi to Andriod device. The other recording option is a compact interface module that provides power to the probe and data transfer via USB to a PC. The Solclino software is used to obtain data, numerical and graphical depicting, saving, reading previously recorded files and generating a report.

The body of the **INCLIS 30** probe is made of AISI 316L steel and has an outer diameter of 30 mm. The light weight of the probe makes it easy to perform surveys in horizontal and deep vertical wells.

**Areas of application:**

*   Physical and mechanical soil properties characterization
*   Identification of cavities
*   Flow index of soils monitoring


**Delivery set:**

*   **INCLIS** probe with stabilizer
*   Cable on reel
*   Interface box (for USB version)
*   Connecting cable (for USB version)
*   Centering Teflon cylinders (2 pcs)
*   Block balance with two adapters
*   SolClino Software
*   Case


**Optional equipment:**

*   Rods for orientation of the probe from the surface
*   Rod guide
*   Rod-to-probe adapter
*   Centralizer 50-160 mm
*   Centralizer 150-500 mm
*   Rod feeder
