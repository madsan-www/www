## Multi-Level 3C Borehole Seismic Array GStreamer-E with Motor Driven Anchoring System

### Main features:

*   Geared motor driven anchor
*   Reliable fixation in the well
*   Individual control of tool anchoring
*   No limit on data sample rate
*   For open hole or cased wells up to 1000 m deep


**GStreamer-E** is a multi-level borehole 3C seismic array with a geared motor driven anchor in each module. The system was developed for vertical seismic profiling (VSP), downhole seismic logging, cross-hole seismic testing and tomography (CST). Tool anchoring individual control allows to eliminate intermodular cable sections tension and the acoustic connection along it. Controlled anchoring also permits the use of GStreamer-E in both cased and open hole wells up to 1000 m deep. It can consist of 1, 4 or 8 3C borehole geophones.

Three pairs of orthogonally combined geophones with a natural frequency of 12 Hz or 20 Hz are used as sensitive elements. Signal registration is provided by almost any seismograph. Upon request, the tool can be equipped with lower frequency sensors, but this will slightly increase its dimensions.

**GStreamer-E** can be equipped with a connector for reference land geophone to control source-seismograph synchronization and improve the accuracy of interval velocities calculation.

**GStreamer-E** with borehole source SHock of horizontally polarized shear wave (SH) is an advanced set of equipment for cross-hole seismic tomography survey in dry and water-filled wells with a distance between them up to 30 m. GeoSV would be enough for cross-hole seismic testing in accordance with ASTM D4428 / D4428M. Borehole sparker Pulse allows to significantly increase distances between the wells. All borehole sources are operated by pulsed power supply Jack.

Multi-level probe **GStreamer-E** can be supplied on a reel with a slip ring. The efficiency and safety of work in deep wells are ensured by BGW and BGW light winches.

**Delivery set:**

Single level 3C system:

*   GStreamer-E tool on cable
*   Single channel anchoring system remote control


Multi-level 3C array:

*   4 or 8 GStreamer-E tools on cable
*   Multi-channel anchoring system remote control


**In addition to GStreamer-E the following items can be purchased:**

*   Reel for 12-channel GStreamer-E
*   Reel for 24-channel GStreamer-E
*   BGW or BGW light winch
*   Energy source Jack with remote control JackPad
*   Borehole sources of pressure P (Pulse) or shear SH-waves (SHock) and SV-waves (GeoSV)
*   Borehole hydrophone array WellStreamer
*   High-frequency seismographs Sigma 4+ or DAQlink 4
*   Borehole inclinometer


We have also developed multi-level 3C downhole seismic array GStreamer with a semi-active spring anchoring system, as well as simpler and cheaper GStreamer-P with pneumatic driven anchors.
