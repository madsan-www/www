## Field Scintillation Radiometer SRP-20

### Main features:

*   Fast detection of gamma anomalies
*   High sensitivity of measurements
*   Portability and ease of use
*   Arrow and sound indication
*   Integration time adjustment


SRP-20 is the most advanced version of previously popular radiometers SRP-68 and SRP-97 and their analogue in terms of functional use and application domain. SRP-20, alike previous versions, is a scintillation radiometer and is designed to search for radioactive ores based on their gamma radiation, radiometric surveying of the terrain, radiometric testing of quarries and mine openings and detection of radioactively contaminated zones. The walking and logging (analogues SRP-97K and SRP-68-02/03) versions are commercially available, which differ in the design of the detection unit case with identical metrological characteristics. Due to the presence of Bluetooth and USB interfaces, data can be transferred to a PC in real time. It is also possible to increase the time integration window in order to obtain stable data on anomalies that are close to background values.

**Areas of SRP-20 application:**

*   Radioactive ores search by gamma radiation
*   Radiometric surveying of the terrain
*   Radiometric testing of quarries and mine openings
*   Detection of radioactive contamination zones
*   Gamma-ray logging


**Distinctive features of SRP-20:**

*   Designed to work in the field
*   Capability to adjust the time integration window
*   Built-in Bluetooth and USB
*   Capability to visualize data on a PC
*   Sealed detection unit for walking mode can be used in shallow boreholes or for underwater objects surveying
*   Unified console for operation with logging and walking mode detection unit


**Package contents:**

*   Walking mode detection unit
*   Measuring console
*   Battery (built-in)
*   Charger
*   Headphones
*   Control source (Co-60) in a container
*   Rugged Case
