## Borehole Source of SV-Waves GeoSV

### Main features:

*   Designed for parallel CST following ASTM D4428 / D4428M
*   Easy switching to generate SV+ and SV- waves
*   Doesn’t require orientation in the well
*   Works in dry and water-filled wells
*   Supplied on a reel


Borehole electrodynamic source **GeoSV** is used for generating vertically polarized shear waves (SV) in dry and water-filled wells up to 200 m deep during parallel cross-hole seismic testing (CST) with distance between boreholes 3 - 6 m. To generate P-waves a borehole sparker [Pulse](https://geodevice.ca/product/pulse/) is usually used. Both sources require energy source [Jack](https://geodevice.ca/product/jack/). The multi-wave parallel CST allows to obtain reliable vertical distributions of Vp and Vs in the crosshole medium and to calculate Poisson's ratio, as well as Young's and shear moduli proceeding to the evaluation of physical and mechanical properties.

**GeoSV** has a pneumatic anchoring system for fixing in a borehole, that allows to generate bipolar shear SV+ and SV- polarized waves. The advantage of using an SV source is the possibility of registering the signal with 3C VSP probe on vertical (Z) component. Thus, polarization analysis for obtaining shear wave data is not required. Source **GeoSV** fully complies with ASTM D4428/D4428M.

**GeoSV application areas:**

*   Physical and mechanical soil properties characterization
*   Soil stabilization control
*   Engineering surveys for the construction of highly sensitive facilities
*   Geotechnical monitoring


**The set includes:**

*   Source GeoSV
*   High voltage cable line on a reel
*   Pneumatic tube on a reel
*   Switchbox
*   Energy source Jack connection cable


**In addition to GeoSV source the following items can be purchased:**

*   Energy source [Jack](https://geodevice.ca/product/jack/) with JackPad remote control
*   3C borehole probe with spring ([GStreamer](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer/)), pneumatic ([GStreamer-P](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer-p/)) or electromechanical ([GStreamer-E](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer-e/)) anchoring system
*   High frequency seismic station [Sigma 4+](https://geodevice.ca/product/sigma4/) or [DAQlink 4](https://geodevice.ca/product/daqlink4/)
*   Borehole sparker [Pulse](https://geodevice.ca/product/pulse/)
*   Borehole hydrophone array [WellStreamer](https://geodevice.ca/product/wellstreamer/)
*   Borehole inclinometer [INCLIS](https://geodevice.ca/product/inclis/)
