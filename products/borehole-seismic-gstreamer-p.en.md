## GStreamer-P Multi-level 3C Borehole Seismic Array with Pneumatic Anchoring System

### Main features:

*   No limit on data sample rate
*   Pneumatic anchoring system
*   Simultaneous anchoring of all levels
*   For open hole or cased wells up to 1000 m deep
*   The anchoring is not weakened when the soil subsides under the anchor


**GStreamer-P** was developed for VSP, downhole seismic logging, [cross-hole seismic testing and tomography (CST)](https://geodevice.ca/info/publications/) in open hole or cased wells up to 1000 m deep. The system can have 4 or 8 borehole 3C tools on a pneumoelectric cable line.

Acquisition unit locking is provided by an anchoring arm driven by a pneumatic cylinder and can be used in dry or water-filled wells. The clamping force is almost independent of hydrostatic pressure. At 7 Bar the system provides a force of 30 kg, which corresponds to a 1:11 ratio relative to the probe weight, that correlates to the parameters of “oil & gas” VSP tools.

Pneumatic anchoring has several advantages:

*   The tool cannot get stuck in the well - a simple release of pressure guarantees folding of the spring-loaded anchor
*   The clamping force does not decrease when the soil subsides under the anchor – the pressure in the pneumatic cylinder works like a powerful spring
*   The design of the probe is as reliable as possible - there is nothing that can break in it
*   Simple simultaneous pressure control with any compressor


**GStreamer-P** has doubled geophones for each component with a natural frequency of 12 or 20 Hz. Upon request, tools can be equipped with lower frequency sensors, but this will slightly increase their dimensions. Registration is provided by any seismograph.

The system can be equipped with a connector for reference land geophone to control source-seismograph synchronization and improve the accuracy of interval velocities calculation.

**GStreamer-P** with borehole source [SHock](https://geodevice.ca/product/shock/) of horizontally polarized shear wave (SH) is an advanced set of equipment for cross-hole seismic tomography survey in dry and water-filled wells with a distance up to 30 m between them. [GeoSV](https://geodevice.ca/product/geosv/) source would be enough for cross-hole seismic testing in accordance with ASTM D4428 / D4428M. You can read about these techniques [here](https://geodevice.ca/info/publications/). Borehole sources are operated by pulsed power supply [Jack](https://geodevice.ca/product/jack/).

The system can be delivered on a reel with a slip ring or a [BGW](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw/) / [BGW light](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw_light/) winches.

**Delivery set:**

*   4 or 8 tools multi-level 3C borehole array GStreamer-P
*   Portable battery powered air compressor pump (up to 7 bar)


**In addition to GStreamer-P the following items can be purchased:**

*   Reel for 12-channel GStreamer-P
*   Reel for 24-channel GStreamer-P
*   [BGW](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw/) or [BGW light](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw_light/) winch
*   Air compressor pump (up to 15 bar)
*   Energy source [Jack](https://geodevice.ca/product/jack/) with remote control JackPad
*   Borehole sources of pressure P ([Pulse](https://geodevice.ca/product/pulse/)) or shear SH-waves ([SHock](https://geodevice.ca/product/shock/)) and SV-waves ([GeoSV](https://geodevice.ca/product/geosv/))
*   Borehole hydrophone array [WellStreamer](https://geodevice.ca/product/wellstreamer/)
*   High-frequency seismographs [Sigma 4+](https://geodevice.ca/product/sigma4/) or [DAQlink 4](https://geodevice.ca/product/daqlink4/)
*   Borehole inclinometer


We have also developed multi-level 3C system [GStreamer](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer/) with spring anchors and [GStreamer-E](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer-e/) with individually controlled electromechanical anchors.
