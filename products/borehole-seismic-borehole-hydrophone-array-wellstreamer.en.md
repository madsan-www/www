## Borehole Hydrophone Array WellStreamer

### Main features:

*   Specifically designed for HR borehole surveys
*   Fast and simple infield operations
*   High sensitive acceleration-free piezoceramic sensors
*   Small diameter and light weight
*   Compatible with any seismograph


WellStreamer is a borehole hydrophone array, specially developed for seismic acquisitions in water-filled wells. We designed an exceptionally easy to use and robust receiver tool with sensitive acceleration-free piezoceramic sensors and signal preamplifiers in each module for registering compressional (P) waves during VSP, cross hole surveys, parallel seismic testing, and other high-resolution borehole seismic techniques. WellStreamer is also used for geotechnical monitoring of the structure of berths, dams, and other hydraulic structures - in this case, it can be located below the water surface on one side of the construction. Measuring the length of piles by parallel seismic testing, geotechnical control of the soil stabilization process, control of the continuity and thickness of the ice wall during the mine shaft construction are also hydrophone array applications.

WellStreamer can be supplied in various configurations, starting from 4 channels and up to 48 units with a typical separation of 1 m or 2 m. It can be equipped with a connector for reference land geophone to control source-seismograph synchronization during VSP survey and to improve the accuracy of interval velocities calculation. Signal registration is provided by almost any seismograph.

Mounted on a reel with a slip ring, which can be ordered with the streamer, it provides easy to operate data acquisition solution without spending time on unplugging equipment during cable operations. The convenience and safety of work in deep wells are ensured by specialized winches [BGW](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw/) and [BGW light](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw_light/).
