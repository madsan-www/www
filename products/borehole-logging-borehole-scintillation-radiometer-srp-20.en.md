## Borehole Scintillation Radiometer SRP-20

### Main features:

*   Fast assessment of rocks’ natural radioactivity
*   High sensitivity of measurements
*   Portable and easy to use
*   Adjustable averaging window
*   Supplied with control source (Co-60)


Borehole scintillation radiometer SRP-20 − the most advanced version of well-known logging radiometers SRP-97K and SRP-68-02/03 and their analogue in terms of functionality and application. The device is designed to conduct gamma-ray logging in wells up to 300 m depth and drillings. The borehole and [hand-held](https://geodevice.ca/product/srp-20/) (analogue of SRP-68-01, SRP-88 and SRP-97) versions are in series production.

When conducting gamma-ray logging, a continuous curve or chart is recorded, which displays the intensity of gamma radiation in µR/hr. Due to natural absorption by host rock, ionizing radiation from rocks and objects within a radius of up to 30 cm from the scintillation detector is recorded.

**Why SRP-20?**

*   Borehole radiometer SRP-20 includes both probe and control unit, so that it becomes all-sufficient system for gamma-ray logging
*   Waterproof detection unit of borehole version can be used both in dry / filled with liquid boreholes and with any types of casing (or without it)
*   Waterproof control unit
*   User friendly interface and simple operation
*   Built-in Bluetooth and USB enable real time data visualization on a PC or smartphone (tablet)
*   The instrument can be supplied with a well logging rod feeder system and a set of rods in order to use the probe in horizontal, inclined, and ascending wells and drillings
*   Adjustment of time averaging window enables to record stable data on low level anomalies and provides immediate response during quick scanning
*   Upon request, the detection unit can be manufactured for placing in a more than 300 m deep boreholes
*   Easy-to-use pointer indicator equipped with a stepper motor eliminates oscillations caused by measuring console movement
*   Indicator backlight provides comfort measurements at any conditions
*   Rugged transport case, Co-60 control source and high-quality open type headphones


**Areas of SRP-20 application:**

*   Radioactive / nonradioactive ore exploration
*   Lithology studies in boreholes
*   Identification and refinement of reservoir intervals (oil and gas-saturated formations)
*   Tying to depth during perforating operations
*   Determination of clay content and fracturing of rocks


**Package contents:**

*   Logging probe
*   Measuring console with built-in battery
*   Charger
*   Headphones
*   Control source (Co-60) in a container
*   Rugged Case
*   Reel with slip ring
*   Well logging rod feeder system with rods (optionally)
