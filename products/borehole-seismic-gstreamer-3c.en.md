## GStreamer-3C Multi-Level Downhole Seismic Array with Spring Anchoring

### Main features:

*   Remote triggering of anchoring system
*   Most compact and lightweight in the world
*   No extra load required to lower into the well
*   Compatible with almost all seismographs
*   Simple and reliable design


**GStreamer** is designed for vertical seismic profiling (VSP) and [cross-hole seismic testing and tomography (CST)](https://geodevice.ca/info/publications/) in boreholes with PVC casing. Tool locking is provided by a spring system with controlled remote triggering. It can consist of 4 or 8 borehole 3C geophones on a cable.

The use of a spring system allowed to smooth the dependence of the clamping force from the well diameter. The ratio is between 1:7 - 1:11 relative to the tool weight, that correlates to the parameters of “oil & gas” VSP probes and guarantees the highest data quality.

**GStreamer** has two geophones for each component with a natural frequency of 12 Hz. This grouping allowed to increase the sensitivity and at the same time maintain the minimum dimensions of the tool. Data registration is provided by almost any seismograph.

At the user's request, **GStreamer** can be equipped with a connector for reference geophone on the surface to control source-seismograph synchronization and improve the accuracy of interval velocities calculation.

**GStreamer** with borehole sources of shear waves [SHock](https://geodevice.ca/product/shock/) or [GeoSV](https://geodevice.ca/product/geosv/) are designed for crosshole seismic testing (ASTM D4428 / D4428M) or crosshole seismic tomography with registration of P and S waves in dry and water-filled wells. You can read about these technologies [here](https://geodevice.ca/info/publications/).

**GStreamer** can be supplied on a reel or a [BGW light](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw_light/) winch, both with a slip ring.

**Delivery set:**

*   4 or 8 tools multi-level 3C borehole array GStreamer
*   Additional set of springs
*   Wire rope on a reel for triggering anchoring system and securing


**In addition to GStreamer the following items can be purchased:**

*   Reel for a 12-channel GStreamer
*   Reel for a 24-channel GStreamer
*   [BGW light](https://geodevice.ca/product/bgw_light/) winch
*   Energy source [Jack](https://geodevice.ca/product/jack/) with remote control JackPad
*   Borehole sources of pressure P ([Pulse](https://geodevice.ca/product/pulse/)) or shear SH-waves ([SHock](https://geodevice.ca/product/shock/)) and SV-waves ([GeoSV](https://geodevice.ca/product/geosv/))
*   Borehole hydrophone array [WellStreamer](https://geodevice.ca/product/wellstreamer/)
*   High-frequency seismographs [Sigma 4+](https://geodevice.ca/product/sigma4/) or [DAQlink 4](https://geodevice.ca/product/daqlink4/)
*   Borehole inclinometer


We have also developed multi-level 3C systems [GStreamer-E](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer-e/) with individually controlled electromechanical anchor, as well as simpler and cheaper [GStreamer-P](https://geodevice.ca/product/gstreamer-p/) with pneumatic driven anchors.

**Example of VSP data (Z component) acquired with GStreamer.**

The distance between the source (sledgehammer) position and wellhead is 5 m. Borehole receiver position spacing - 1 m, depth range - from 5 to 124 m.

**Example of S-waves VSP data acquired with GStreamer.**

Horizontal component after orientation and subtraction of right and left shots. The distance between the source (sledgehammer) position and wellhead is 0.6 m. Borehole receiver position spacing - 1 m, depth range - from 1 to 120 m.
