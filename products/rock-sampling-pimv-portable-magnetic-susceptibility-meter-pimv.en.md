## Portable Magnetic Susceptibility Meter PIMV

### Main features:

*   Lightweight and portable
*   High sensitivity - 1x10-7 SI units
*   4 measuring modes
*   Built-in GPS/GLONASS
*   Bluetooth and USB
*   Voice recording


Portable Magnetic Susceptibility Meter PIMV is designed to measure the magnetic susceptibility of rocks in field on outcrops, samples and cores from boreholes. The device is used in geological mapping, petromagnetic studies and solves the problem of rocks and ores differentiation in accordance with their magnetic susceptibility values with sensitivity up to 10-7 SI.

**Measuring modes:**

*   Simple mode — for fast single measurements
*   Scanning mode provides information about the distribution of the magnetic susceptibility over the surface of the object. In this mode, measurements are carried out automatically 2 times per second
*   Averaging mode — to obtain the average value of the magnetic susceptibility from several measurements
*   Lab mode permits to transfer automatically measured values to PC / PDA via USB and Bluetooth interfaces


PIMV supports miniSD cards (up to 32 GB), is equipped with a GLONASS / GPS module, that fixes the geographic coordinates of measurement point, and allows recording voice comments to each measurement. The PIMVdata software, supplied with the device, is used to transfer data from the device to a PC via Bluetooth. When connected via USB interface, the device is recognized as an external flash drive and does not require additional software. Data is exported in Excel (csv) or txt formats. PIMV has three built-in AAA rechargeable batteries, which, if necessary, are replaced with standard batteries. The device is protected according to the IP65 standard.

**Delivery set includes:**

*   Magnetic susceptibility meter PIMV
*   Case
*   Operating manual
*   Charging dock
*   PIMVdata software
